# ChromeKiller
C# My 2nd ever program...Sort of.  This is simply the console version of my 1st program in reverse.

SCENARIO:  My Kids are staying up SUPER late watching netflix, Hulu, etc. I dont want to remove the PC just limit its usage

SOLUTION:  I have created this console program to work in conjunction with Windows Task Scheduler.  This program will scan
           running processes searching for google chrome at bedtime, if Chrome is running the program will kill the chrome process
           play windows shutdown music then flash a message to the girls telling them its time for bed and display the current time.
           
  Any feedback is greatly appreciated!!!  
  
  PS: I just realized that all one would need to do is simply switch browsers to circumvent this program...perhaps I will incorporate
  more browsers in an update.
